# Specification: Chapter 16 - Voice-to-Action with Whisper

## Feature Description

I need to create Chapter 16 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook: "Voice-to-Action with Whisper"

## Chapter Overview

**Chapter Number**: 16
**Chapter Title**: Voice-to-Action with Whisper
**Part**: Part V - Vision-Language-Action
**Status**: Summary placeholder (full content in future updates)
**Word Count Target**: 400-500 words
**Prerequisites**: Chapter 15: Manipulation and Grasping

## Summary Requirements

### SR1: Chapter Title with Status Indicator
```markdown
# Chapter 16: Voice-to-Action with Whisper

## 🚧 Chapter Summary (Full Content Coming Soon)
```

### SR2: Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points)
After completing this chapter, students should be able to:
- Understand speech recognition integration with robotics systems
- Implement voice command processing for robot control
- Connect audio input with action execution pipelines
- Design natural language interfaces for robot interaction

### SR3: Key Topics Overview (150-200 words)
**Whisper Integration**: OpenAI's Whisper model provides state-of-the-art speech recognition capabilities that can be integrated into robotics systems. The model can transcribe spoken commands with high accuracy, enabling natural human-robot interaction through voice commands.

**Command Mapping**: Converting speech to actionable robot commands requires mapping recognized text to specific robot behaviors. This involves natural language processing to extract intent and parameters from spoken commands, translating them into robot actions.

**Real-time Processing**: Voice-to-action systems must process audio input in real-time while maintaining robot operation. This requires efficient audio processing pipelines and low-latency communication between speech recognition and robot control systems.

### SR4: Prerequisites (50 words)
Students should have completed Chapter 15 on Manipulation and Grasping. Understanding of robot control systems, basic NLP concepts, and ROS 2 communication patterns will be helpful for implementing voice interfaces.

### SR5: What You'll Build/Learn (50-75 words)
Students will learn to integrate speech recognition with robot systems, process voice commands in real-time, map spoken instructions to robot actions, and create natural language interfaces for robot control.

### SR6: Real-World Applications (75-100 words)
**Industry Example 1**: Healthcare robots use voice interfaces to respond to patient requests and assist with daily activities in assisted living facilities.

**Industry Example 2**: Service robots in hospitality environments accept voice commands for navigation tasks, information retrieval, and customer assistance functions.

### SR7: Why This Matters (75-100 words)
Voice-to-action interfaces make robots more accessible and intuitive for human users. By enabling natural language interaction, robots can be controlled by non-technical users, expanding their potential applications in homes, healthcare, and service industries where traditional interfaces may be impractical.

### SR8: Coming Soon Section (50-75 words)
When fully developed, this chapter will include:
- Detailed explanations of Whisper integration with robots
- Code examples for voice processing pipelines
- Diagrams of speech-to-action architectures
- Hands-on exercises with voice command mapping

### SR9: Related Resources (2-3 links)
- [Official documentation link]: OpenAI Whisper documentation and robotics integration guides
- [Tutorial or paper]: "Natural Language Interfaces for Robot Control"

### SR10: Placeholder Notice

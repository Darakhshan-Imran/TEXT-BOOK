## Feature Description

I need to create Chapter 7 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook: "Physics Simulation with Gazebo"

## Chapter Overview

**Chapter Number**: 7
**Chapter Title**: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
**Part**: Part III - The Digital Twin: Simulation
**Status**: Summary placeholder (full content in future updates)
**Word Count Target**: 400-500 words
**Prerequisites**: Chapter 6: Launch Files and System Integration

## Summary Requirements

### SR1: Chapter Title with Status Indicator
```markdown
# Chapter 7: Physics Simulation with Gazebo

## 🚧 Chapter Summary (Full Content Coming Soon)
```

### SR2: Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points)
After completing this chapter, students should be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of physics simulation for robotics
- Set up Gazebo simulation environments with realistic physics
- Integrate simulated robots with ROS 2 for testing and development
- Compare simulation results with real-world robot behavior

### SR3: Key Topics Overview (150-200 words)
**Gazebo Simulation Environment**: Gazebo provides a realistic 3D physics simulation environment that allows roboticists to test algorithms and behaviors before deploying to real hardware. The simulation includes accurate physics modeling, sensor simulation, and realistic environmental conditions.

**Physics Engine Integration**: Gazebo uses advanced physics engines like ODE, Bullet, and DART to provide accurate simulation of rigid body dynamics, collisions, and contact forces. This enables realistic testing of robot control algorithms and navigation systems.

**ROS 2 Integration**: Seamless integration with ROS 2 allows simulated robots to communicate with the same nodes and systems as real robots, making the transition from simulation to reality more straightforward. This includes support for all ROS 2 message types and services.

### SR4: Prerequisites (50 words)
Students should have completed Chapter 6 on Launch Files and System Integration. Understanding of URDF robot descriptions and basic ROS 2 concepts is essential for working with Gazebo simulation environments.

### SR5: What You'll Build/Learn (50-75 words)
Students will learn to create simulation worlds with Gazebo, spawn robots in simulated environments, and run ROS 2 nodes that interact with simulated sensors and actuators, providing a safe environment for testing complex robot behaviors.

### SR6: Real-World Applications (75-100 words)
**Industry Example 1**: Tesla uses simulation environments to test autonomous driving algorithms before real-world deployment, significantly reducing development time and risk.

**Industry Example 2**: Boston Dynamics leverages physics simulation for robot development and testing, allowing for rapid iteration on complex locomotion algorithms.

### SR7: Why This Matters (75-100 words)
Physics simulation is critical in robotics because it allows for safe, cost-effective testing of complex behaviors without risk to expensive hardware. It enables rapid prototyping of control algorithms and provides a bridge between theoretical development and real-world deployment, significantly reducing the time and cost of robot development.

### SR8: Coming Soon Section (50-75 words)
When fully developed, this chapter will include:
- Detailed explanations of Gazebo world creation
- Code examples for robot simulation
- Diagrams of simulation architecture
- Hands-on exercises with physics parameters

### SR9: Related Resources (2-3 links)
- [Official documentation link]: Gazebo simulation tutorials and documentation
- [Tutorial or paper]: "Simulation-Reality Gap in Robotics: Challenges and Solutions"

### SR10: Placeholder Notice
```markdown

# Specification: Chapter 8 - Sensor Simulation

## Feature Description

I need to create Chapter 8 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook: "Sensor Simulation"

## Chapter Overview

**Chapter Number**: 8
**Chapter Title**: Sensor Simulation
**Part**: Part III - The Digital Twin: Simulation
**Status**: Summary placeholder (full content in future updates)
**Word Count Target**: 400-500 words
**Prerequisites**: Chapter 7: Physics Simulation with Gazebo

## Summary Requirements

### SR1: Chapter Title with Status Indicator
```markdown
# Chapter 8: Sensor Simulation

## 🚧 Chapter Summary (Full Content Coming Soon)
```

### SR2: Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points)
After completing this chapter, students should be able to:
- Understand how different sensor types are simulated in virtual environments
- Configure realistic sensor models for cameras, LIDAR, IMUs, and other sensors
- Compare simulated sensor data with real-world sensor characteristics
- Integrate simulated sensors with ROS 2 for perception system testing

### SR3: Key Topics Overview (150-200 words)
**Camera Simulation**: Simulated cameras provide realistic visual data with configurable parameters like resolution, field of view, and noise characteristics. These simulations help test computer vision algorithms before deployment on real hardware.

**LIDAR and Range Sensor Simulation**: LIDAR simulation models the physics of light reflection to generate accurate depth and distance measurements. This includes simulating beam divergence, reflections, and environmental factors that affect real sensors.

**Inertial Sensor Simulation**: IMU and other inertial sensor simulation includes modeling noise, drift, and environmental factors that affect real sensors. This allows for testing navigation and control algorithms with realistic sensor limitations.

### SR4: Prerequisites (50 words)
Students should have completed Chapter 7 on Physics Simulation with Gazebo. Understanding of basic sensor types and ROS 2 message formats is essential for working with sensor simulation.

### SR5: What You'll Build/Learn (50-75 words)
Students will learn to configure realistic sensor models in simulation environments, generate synthetic sensor data that matches real-world characteristics, and validate perception algorithms using simulated inputs before real-world testing.

### SR6: Real-World Applications (75-100 words)
**Industry Example 1**: Waymo uses sensor simulation to test autonomous driving systems with millions of virtual miles, simulating various weather conditions and sensor failure scenarios.

**Industry Example 2**: NASA uses sensor simulation for space robotics, allowing testing of planetary exploration robots with realistic camera and LIDAR data from virtual planetary environments.

### SR7: Why This Matters (75-100 words)
Sensor simulation is crucial because real sensors are expensive, can be damaged during testing, and may not be available during early development phases. Simulation allows for testing edge cases, failure modes, and environmental conditions that would be difficult or dangerous to reproduce with real hardware, accelerating development cycles.

### SR8: Coming Soon Section (50-75 words)
When fully developed, this chapter will include:
- Detailed explanations of sensor model configuration
- Code examples for sensor integration
- Diagrams of sensor simulation architecture
- Hands-on exercises with sensor parameters

### SR9: Related Resources (2-3 links)
- [Official documentation link]: Gazebo sensor plugins documentation
- [Tutorial or paper]: "Realistic Sensor Simulation for Robotics Development"

### SR10: Placeholder Notice
```markdown

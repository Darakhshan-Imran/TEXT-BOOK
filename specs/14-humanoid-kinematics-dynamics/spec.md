# Specification: Chapter 14 - Humanoid Kinematics and Dynamics

## Feature Description

I need to create Chapter 14 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook: "Humanoid Kinematics and Dynamics"

## Chapter Overview

**Chapter Number**: 14
**Chapter Title**: Humanoid Kinematics and Dynamics
**Part**: Part V - Vision-Language-Action
**Status**: Summary placeholder (full content in future updates)
**Word Count Target**: 400-500 words
**Prerequisites**: Chapter 13: Navigation with Nav2

## Summary Requirements

### SR1: Chapter Title with Status Indicator
```markdown
# Chapter 14: Humanoid Kinematics and Dynamics

## 🚧 Chapter Summary (Full Content Coming Soon)
```

### SR2: Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points)
After completing this chapter, students should be able to:
- Understand forward and inverse kinematics for humanoid robots
- Analyze the dynamics of multi-link robotic systems
- Implement balance and locomotion control for bipedal robots
- Compare different approaches to humanoid motion planning

### SR3: Key Topics Overview (150-200 words)
**Kinematic Chains**: Humanoid robots feature complex kinematic chains with multiple degrees of freedom that require sophisticated mathematical models to describe their motion. Forward kinematics computes end-effector positions from joint angles, while inverse kinematics solves for joint angles to achieve desired end-effector positions.

**Dynamic Modeling**: Humanoid dynamics involve complex interactions between multiple links, actuators, and environmental forces. Dynamic models account for Coriolis forces, centripetal forces, and gravitational effects that influence robot motion and stability.

**Balance Control**: Maintaining balance in bipedal robots requires real-time control algorithms that adjust center of mass and foot placement. Techniques like Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) are essential for stable humanoid locomotion.

### SR4: Prerequisites (50 words)
Students should have completed Chapter 13 on Navigation with Nav2. Understanding of basic mechanics, linear algebra, and robot control concepts will be essential for grasping humanoid kinematics and dynamics.

### SR5: What You'll Build/Learn (50-75 words)
Students will learn to model humanoid robot kinematics, implement balance control algorithms, analyze dynamic stability, and develop locomotion patterns for bipedal walking and movement.

### SR6: Real-World Applications (75-100 words)
**Industry Example 1**: Boston Dynamics' Atlas robot demonstrates advanced humanoid kinematics with complex acrobatic movements and stable bipedal locomotion in challenging terrain.

**Industry Example 2**: Honda's ASIMO robot showcases sophisticated kinematic control for human-like walking, stair climbing, and object manipulation capabilities.

### SR7: Why This Matters (75-100 words)
Humanoid kinematics and dynamics are fundamental to creating robots that can operate in human environments. Understanding these principles enables the development of robots that can walk, balance, manipulate objects, and interact with the world in ways that are natural and efficient, opening possibilities for human-robot collaboration.

### SR8: Coming Soon Section (50-75 words)
When fully developed, this chapter will include:
- Detailed explanations of kinematic equations
- Code examples for kinematic solvers
- Diagrams of humanoid joint configurations
- Hands-on exercises with motion planning

### SR9: Related Resources (2-3 links)
- [Official documentation link]: Humanoid robotics research papers and documentation
- [Tutorial or paper]: "Humanoid Robot Kinematics and Control Methods"

### SR10: Placeholder Notice

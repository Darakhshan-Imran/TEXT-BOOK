## Summary Requirements

### SR1: Chapter Title with Status Indicator
```markdown
# Chapter 11: Isaac Sim - Photorealistic Simulation

## 🚧 Chapter Summary (Full Content Coming Soon)
```

### SR2: Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points)
After completing this chapter, students should be able to:
- Understand the capabilities of Isaac Sim for robotics simulation
- Create photorealistic environments for robot training
- Generate synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth
- Integrate Isaac Sim with ROS 2 and other robotics frameworks

### SR3: Key Topics Overview (150-200 words)
**Omniverse Integration**: Isaac Sim is built on NVIDIA Omniverse, providing real-time, physically-accurate simulation with photorealistic rendering. This enables the creation of complex virtual environments that closely match real-world conditions for effective robot training.

**Synthetic Data Generation**: Isaac Sim excels at generating large volumes of labeled training data with perfect ground truth information. This includes semantic segmentation masks, depth maps, and 3D bounding boxes that are expensive and time-consuming to create with real-world data.

**Physics Simulation**: Beyond visual fidelity, Isaac Sim provides accurate physics simulation with realistic material properties, lighting conditions, and environmental interactions. This ensures that robots trained in simulation can transfer their capabilities to real-world scenarios.

### SR4: Prerequisites (50 words)
Students should have completed Chapter 10 on NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem Overview. Understanding of simulation concepts and basic ROS 2 integration will be helpful for working with Isaac Sim's advanced features.

### SR5: What You'll Build/Learn (50-75 words)
Students will learn to create complex virtual environments in Isaac Sim, generate synthetic training data for AI models, configure realistic physics properties, and validate robot behaviors in photorealistic simulations.

### SR6: Real-World Applications (75-100 words)
**Industry Example 1**: Waymo uses Isaac Sim for generating diverse driving scenarios with photorealistic rendering to train autonomous vehicle perception systems with millions of virtual miles.

**Industry Example 2**: NVIDIA's own robotics research leverages Isaac Sim to develop and validate new AI algorithms before deploying them on real hardware, significantly reducing development time.

### SR7: Why This Matters (75-100 words)
Photorealistic simulation with Isaac Sim bridges the reality gap in robotics by providing training environments that closely match real-world conditions. This enables the development of robust AI systems that can generalize from simulation to reality, reducing the need for extensive real-world testing while improving safety and efficiency of development processes.

### SR8: Coming Soon Section (50-75 words)

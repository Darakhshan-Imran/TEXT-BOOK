## Summary Requirements

### SR1: Chapter Title with Status Indicator
```markdown
# Chapter 20: Deploying to Edge Hardware

## 🚧 Chapter Summary (Full Content Coming Soon)
```

### SR2: Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points)
After completing this chapter, students should be able to:
- Understand the constraints and requirements of edge computing for robotics
- Optimize robot algorithms for resource-constrained hardware
- Deploy complete robot systems to edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson
- Evaluate performance trade-offs between computation and autonomy

### SR3: Key Topics Overview (150-200 words)
**Edge Computing Platforms**: Robotics applications require specialized edge computing platforms that balance computational power, energy efficiency, and real-time performance. Popular platforms include NVIDIA Jetson series, Raspberry Pi, and custom edge AI chips designed for robotics applications.

**Resource Optimization**: Deploying to edge hardware requires optimization techniques including model quantization, algorithm simplification, and efficient memory management. These optimizations ensure that complex AI algorithms can run within the constraints of edge devices.

**Real-Time Considerations**: Edge deployment must account for real-time requirements, thermal management, power consumption, and reliability. This includes implementing fallback mechanisms and ensuring consistent performance under varying environmental conditions.

### SR4: Prerequisites (50 words)
Students should have completed Chapter 19 on the Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project. Understanding of robot system architecture, basic hardware concepts, and performance optimization will be essential for edge deployment.

### SR5: What You'll Build/Learn (50-75 words)
Students will learn to optimize robot systems for edge hardware, deploy complete robot applications to edge devices, configure real-time performance parameters, and evaluate the trade-offs between computational power and autonomy.

### SR6: Real-World Applications (75-100 words)
**Industry Example 1**: Autonomous delivery robots use edge computing to process sensor data locally, making real-time navigation decisions without relying on cloud connectivity in urban environments.

**Industry Example 2**: Agricultural robots deploy edge AI systems to identify crops and weeds in real-time, controlling precision spraying systems without network connectivity in remote fields.

### SR7: Why This Matters (75-100 words)
Edge deployment is critical for practical robotics applications where real-time performance, privacy, and connectivity independence are essential. Understanding edge computing constraints enables the development of practical robotic systems that can operate reliably in real-world conditions without depending on cloud infrastructure.

### SR8: Coming Soon Section (50-75 words)
When fully developed, this chapter will include:
- Detailed explanations of edge computing optimization techniques
- Code examples for hardware-specific deployment
- Diagrams of edge computing architectures
- Hands-on exercises with Jetson and other platforms

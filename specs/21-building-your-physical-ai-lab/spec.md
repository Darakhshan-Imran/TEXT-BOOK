## Summary Requirements

### SR1: Chapter Title with Status Indicator
```markdown
# Chapter 21: Building Your Physical AI Lab

## 🚧 Chapter Summary (Full Content Coming Soon)
```

### SR2: Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points)
After completing this chapter, students should be able to:
- Design and set up a physical AI laboratory for robotics development
- Select appropriate hardware and tools for different robotics projects
- Establish safety protocols and best practices for robot testing
- Create an efficient workflow for robotics research and development

### SR3: Key Topics Overview (150-200 words)
**Hardware Selection**: A physical AI lab requires careful selection of robots, sensors, computing platforms, and development tools. This includes choosing between different robot platforms (wheeled, legged, manipulator arms), sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMUs), and computing systems based on project requirements and budget constraints.

**Safety Protocols**: Working with physical robots requires comprehensive safety measures including physical barriers, emergency stops, collision detection, and proper ventilation. These protocols protect both researchers and equipment during development and testing phases.

**Lab Organization**: An efficient lab layout maximizes productivity with dedicated spaces for development, testing, and storage. This includes areas for electronics work, mechanical assembly, and safe robot operation with appropriate flooring, lighting, and power distribution.

### SR4: Prerequisites (50 words)
Students should have completed Chapter 20 on Deploying to Edge Hardware. Understanding of robotics hardware components, safety considerations, and development workflows will be helpful for setting up an effective lab.

### SR5: What You'll Build/Learn (50-75 words)
Students will learn to design an effective robotics lab layout, select appropriate hardware and tools, establish safety protocols, and create workflows for efficient robotics development and testing.

### SR6: Real-World Applications (75-100 words)
**Industry Example 1**: University robotics labs like those at MIT and CMU demonstrate best practices for research-oriented physical AI environments with specialized equipment and safety protocols for advanced robotics research.

**Industry Example 2**: Corporate robotics labs at companies like Google and Amazon showcase industrial approaches to robotics development with focus on rapid prototyping and testing capabilities.

### SR7: Why This Matters (75-100 words)
A well-designed physical AI lab is essential for transitioning from simulation to real-world robotics. It provides the infrastructure needed for testing, validation, and development of practical robotic systems while ensuring safety and efficiency in the research and development process.

### SR8: Coming Soon Section (50-75 words)
When fully developed, this chapter will include:
- Detailed lab design guidelines and equipment lists

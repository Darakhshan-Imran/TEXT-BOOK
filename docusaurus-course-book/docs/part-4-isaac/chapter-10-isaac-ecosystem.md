## What You'll Build

In this chapter, you'll learn to set up and configure the Isaac ecosystem components, including Isaac Sim for simulation and Isaac ROS for perception. You'll create basic applications that leverage Isaac's GPU acceleration and explore synthetic data generation for AI model training.

## Real-World Applications

NVIDIA Isaac is used by companies like Amazon for warehouse robotics, BMW for factory automation, and Boston Dynamics for advanced robot control. Research institutions use Isaac for developing next-generation robotics AI, while automotive companies leverage Isaac for autonomous vehicle development. The ecosystem is particularly popular in applications requiring complex perception, such as object detection, manipulation, and navigation in dynamic environments.

Isaac is also used in healthcare robotics, agricultural automation, and space exploration robotics. Companies developing delivery robots, inspection drones, and autonomous mobile robots rely on Isaac's simulation and perception capabilities. The platform is instrumental in creating digital twins of robotic systems for monitoring and optimization.

## Why This Matters

The Isaac ecosystem provides hardware-accelerated capabilities essential for modern AI-powered robotics applications. It enables the development of perception systems that can process sensor data in real-time using GPU acceleration. The ecosystem's simulation capabilities with photorealistic rendering help generate synthetic training data for AI models, bridging the gap between simulation and reality. Isaac also provides tools for reinforcement learning, which is crucial for developing adaptive robotic behaviors in complex environments.

The ecosystem's integration with standard robotics frameworks allows for gradual adoption of accelerated capabilities without requiring complete system rewrites. This makes Isaac accessible for enhancing existing robotic systems with advanced AI capabilities.

## Coming Soon
